This is a SCSI benchmark test program under ASPI. It can measure Hard-Disk,
MO-Disk, CD-ROM drive's performance.

All the part of this program are written by Borland C++ V3.1. Complete source
files are included. By using its SCSI handling routine, you can write SCSI
program very easily.


How to use
~~~~~~~~~~
This program uses ASPI function call to handling SCSI, so you must add
adequate ASPI manager to your config.sys. For example, if you are using
Adaptec AHA-1542B, you must add ASPI4DOS.sys to your config.sys.

To execute program, type "ASBENCH", then press <Enter> key. If your ASPI
manager is working correctly, device select menu like below will appear.

ASPI SCSI benchmark test V0.2
 copyright(c) by Tsuru-Zoh, Nov.23,1992

Target No.0 : HA#0 ID1  MAXTOR  LXT-535S        8.57  CCS1 Rigid
Target No.1 : HA#0 ID2  MAXTOR  XT-8760S        B6B   CCS1 Rigid
Target No.2 : HA#0 ID6  HITACHI CDR-3650/1650S  0003  CCS1 Removable

Enter target number ( 0 to 2 ) : 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The devices except HDD/MO/CD-ROM will not appear in this menu.
Choose target number to test, then benchmark test will starts. For example,
in this case if you want to test LXT-535S, press '0' and <Enter>. If you
want to test CDR-3650, press '2' and <Enter>.


This benchmark contains 6 tests. There are no data write operations in
tests, so no data in device will be damaged.

1: Test Unit Ready command overhead time
2: Seek command to Logical block 0 overhead time (no motion seek)
3: Sequential block seek command time
4: Random block seek command time
5: Sequential block read transfer rate
6: Random block read transfer rate

This program measures how many commands executed in 5 seconds. For example,
the drive can execute Random Seek 350 times in 5 seconds, average random
seek time is
 5 / 350[sec] = 14[ms]
If the drive can execute 120 times of 8192 bytes sequential read in 5
seconds, average transfer rate is
 8192 * 120 / 5 = 196 KB/s.

This program displays performance rate by Bar-Graph, this value is based
on Hard Disk performance rates that I think it's average value. So if you
measure MO-Disk or CD-ROM drive, its performance rate becomes "Poor" or
"OK", but it's no problem. Performance rate chart is below.

Performance rate chart:
                          Poor  |    OK    |   Good   |   Great   |   Superb
Test Unit Ready command      >2.5ms>    >1.9ms>    >1.3ms>     >0.6ms>
No Motion Seek command       >3.5ms>    >2.6ms>    >1.8ms>     >0.9ms>
Sequential Seek              >10ms>     >7.5ms>      >5ms>     >2.5ms>
Random Seek                  >40ms>     >30ms>      >20ms>      >10ms>
Sequential Read            <400KB/s<    <800KB/s<  <1.2MB/s<   <1.6MB/s<
Random Read                <300KB/s<    <600KB/s<  <900KB/s<   <1.2MB/s<

Please notice that these results includes ASPI manager and SCSI Host
Adapter's overhead time. For example, Adaptec's AHA-1542B has 1.5 to 2ms
of command overhead time.


Known Bugs:
~~~~~~~~~~~
Some of CD-ROM media contains several sector size (ex. 2048/2340Bytes).
In that case, this program will be terminated by read error. If it occurred,
please change CD-ROM media and try again.

Appendix: How to use aspiscsi.c
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Here is a sample program to use aspiscsi.c. It read 1 sector from
 "Host adapter No.0, SCSI-ID 0, SCSI logical block address(LBA) 0"
then dump it. If you save this program as "test.c", please compile it
like below.

bcc test.c aspiscsi.c

(ASPIDOS.txt) in their Data Library.
