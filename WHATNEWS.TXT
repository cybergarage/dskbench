ASBench 0.7 is a modified version, from Gilles Vollant (info@winimage.com).

I've added :
- Sequential test at the end of disk (SeqRd End). The first sequential read (Seq. Read)
are at the beginning of the disk, and the end is often slower...
- There is now a DOS version (ASBN_DOS.EXE) and a Win32 console version (ASBNCH32.EXE).
- CDWriter and Disk with ID > 7 (for Wide disk) are accepted.

ASBN_DOS.EXE can be runned under MSDOS (with ASPI drivers) and Windows 95.
ASBNCH32.EXE can be runned under Windows 95 and Windows NT, but you need the ASPI32 DLL
from Adaptec. For this, get EZSCSI 4.01 package or the file ASPI32.EXE, at ADAPTEC
compuserve forum or by FTP at : ftp://ftp.adaptec.com/pub/BBS/winnt/ASPI32.EXE

In the source directory, you'll find asbench.mak (a Visual C++ 4 makefile for
Win32 version) and makebc5.bat (batchfile for make the DOS version with Borland C) and
as asbench.dsw (Visual C++ 6.0 Makefile).
